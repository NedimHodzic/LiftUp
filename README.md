# LiftUp

This is a lifting app me and a team made called LiftUp. Its main goal is to help new lifters keep track of their progress and provide them with workouts to do.

I lead the backend team working on this app and my main contributions are the Admin, Nutrition, Stats, User, UserNutrition, UserWorkout, and Workout Instance models.
